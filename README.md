# LCA_TASK_CSU33012
Lowest Common Ancestor Task for Software Engineering CSU33012

This repository contains the python implementation of this assignment. I have never used Python previous to this assignment.

Please __see the following files in the Main Branch__ for the final implementation of this problem :
- BinaryTree.py : Contains implementation of a binrary tree (for ints) and the LCA problem
- LCAtest.py : Contains test code for Binary.py using Python Unittest framework
- practiceMain.py : Contains bits of code used for trial and error during assignment 

The Main branch contains a screen capture of the test results and a screen recording of 
the solution running in Visual Studio Code. These are under the following names :
- Test Results Screenshot.png
- Recording LCA Python Implementation .mov

# Approach
I tried to follow a test-driven approach when working on this assignment. I first built a basic implementation of a bianry tree and the LCA solution. Then I tested this. Using my findings from the tests I improved my code further. I repeated this process for 2 times. Each new implementation and round of tests are shown on a seperate branch in this repository. 

# Questions?
If you have any questions or run in to any issues when examing my submission please email me at : spillari@tcd.ie

# Notes : 
- I was delayed beginning on this assignment as I spent week 3 of college attending the F1Tenth autonomous driver competition in Prague with the Formula Trinity Autonomous Team. 
- I also have never worked with git before so spent the start of week 4 trying to get my head around it and figure out what I needed to know or this assignment. I found it quite confusing at first but hopefully think that I got the hang of it by the end of this assignment (after many tutorial videos). If there is anything which I may have been doing wrong in relation to git please let me know :)
- In addition, I have decided to move to visual studios as my new developer environment so have also spent some time trying to familize myself with how this environment works before begininng this project.
- I believe it was mentioned in one of the drop in sessions that a build script and run script could also be submitted  with this assignment. I do not know what these types of scripts entail and have never worked with them before. As this was not mentioned in the original assignment description or the the description on blackboard, and also due to time constraints (I have 3 other assignments due this week), I have decided not write these scripts. However, if you are having any trouble runnign my code, please get in touch with me and I can figure out how to write them and send them on to you.
