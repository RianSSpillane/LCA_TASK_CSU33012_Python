# LCA_TASK_CSU33012
Lowest Common Ancestor Task for Software Engineering CSU33012

This repository contains the python implementation of this assignment (new coding language used)

Please __see the following files in the Main Branch__ for the final implementation of this problem :
- BinaryTree.py : Contains implementation of a binrary tree (for ints) and the LCA problem
- LCAtest.py : Contains test code for Binary.py using Python Unittest framework
- practiceMain.py : Contains bits of code used for trial and error during assignment 

The Main branch contains a screen capture of the test results and a screen recording of 
the solution running in Visual Studio Code. These are under the following names :
- Test Results Screenshot.png
- Recording LCA Python Implementation .mov




Notes : 
- I was delayed beginning on this assignment as I spent week 3 of college attending the F1Tenth autonomous driver competition in Prague with the Formula Trinity Autonomous Team. 
- I also have never worked with git before so spent the start of week 4 trying to get my head around it and figure out what I needed to know or this assignment
- In addition, I have decided to move to visual studios as my new developer environment so have also spent some time trying to familize myself with how this environment works before begininng this project.
